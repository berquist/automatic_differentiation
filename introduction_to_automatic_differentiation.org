The confusing thing is that when we talk about infinitesimals, we often do represent them as very small numbers when performing a computation. However, here we are using infinitesimal purely in the abstract concept sense: it is identical the symbolic notion of an infinitesimal as something that "exists" and is nothing more than a tool, it isn't something that you calculate.

Well, if it isn't a tiny finite number, and it isn't symbolic differentiation, then what is it? They key is to use [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number][dual numbers]]. A dual number looks like a complex number, being represented as \(a + b\epsilon\) rather than \(a + bi\), and having the property \(\epsilon^{2} = 0\) rather than \(i^{2} = -1\)
